# Esoteric Swift

*A collection of obscure Swift programs*

This project aims to collect bizarre (but "legal") Swift programs that the commmunity produces. Like [esoteric programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language), but for weird or nonsensical shit we can do in Swift that actually compiles. 

The less comprehensible, the better — just like normal code.
